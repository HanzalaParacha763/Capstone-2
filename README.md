## ✨ What this repo is
A focused React + Vite template that gives you:
- Vite-powered dev server with fast hot module replacement (HMR)
- React app structure under `src/`
- Opinionated ESLint configuration for consistent code style
- Ready-to-deploy settings (works great with Vercel / Netlify)
- Clean `index.html` and `public/` for static assets

This is **not** a fully finished product — it’s a clean, performant starting point you can extend.
